### Bio

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of [Software and Computer Engineering](http://software.ajou.ac.kr/e_main.php) at [Ajou University](https://ajou.ac.kr/en/index.do). Prior to joining Ajou University, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the AI Institute for Seoul National University ([AIIS](https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/eng/)). In 2025, I earned my Ph.D. in AI from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang](https://bi.snu.ac.kr/members/byoung-tak-zhang.html). I was selected as [RSS Pioneers](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2025/participants?authuser=0) in 2025 and as a [Youlchon AI Star Fellow](https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/bbs/board.php?bo_table=sub4_3&sca=2024) in 2024. 

My research lies at the intersection of multimodal AI and robotics. Specifically, I aim to advance robot learning and human-robot interaction by leveraging semantic, generalizable priors from multimodal AI models.
