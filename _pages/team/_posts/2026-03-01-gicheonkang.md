### Bio

I'm an incoming Assistant Professor in the Department of [Software and Computer Engineering](http://software.ajou.ac.kr/e_main.php) at [Ajou University](https://ajou.ac.kr/en/index.do). My research lies at the intersection of multimodal AI and robotics. Specifically, I push the boundaries of robot learning and human-robot interaction by leveraging semantic priors from large multimodal models. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the AI Institute, Seoul National University ([AIIS](https://aiis.snu.ac.kr/eng/)), and I received my Ph.D. from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/index.html) under the supervision of [Prof. Byoung-Tak Zhang](https://bi.snu.ac.kr/members/byoung-tak-zhang.html) in February 2025. I was selected as [RSS Pioneers](https://sites.google.com/view/rsspioneers2025/participants?authuser=0) in 2025 and as a Youlchon AI Star Fellow in 2024.
