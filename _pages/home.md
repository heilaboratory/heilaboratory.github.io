    <strong>Human-Centered Embodied Intelligence (HEI) lab at Ajou University</strong> develops AI agents that can see, talk, reason, and act in real-world environments. Our mission is to advance robot learning and human-robot interaction by leveraging semantic, generalizable priors from multimodal AI models. Our research focuses on: 1) <strong>Foundation Models for Robotics</strong>—enabling robots to generalize across a wide range of tasks and environments, 2) <strong>Human-Robot Interaction</strong>—establishing natural and collaborative interactions between humans and robots, and 3) <strong>Lifelong Robot Learning</strong>—building systems that continuously acquire new skills and adapt to changing environments through interaction with humans and the physical world. We envision a future where robots seamlessly collaborate with humans as capable, adaptive partners in everyday life.
