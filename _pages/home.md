    <strong>Human-Centered Embodied Intelligence (HEI) lab at Ajou University</strong> builds robots that learn, adapt, and collaborate with humans in the real world. Our mission is to develop machine learning algorithms for robot learning and human-robot interaction. Our research focuses on: 1) <strong>foundation models for robotics</strong>—enabling robots to generalize across a wide range of tasks and environments, 2) <strong>human-robot interaction</strong>—establishing natural and collaborative interactions between humans and robots, and 3) <strong>lifelong robot learning</strong>—building systems that continuously acquire new skills and adapt to changing environments through interaction with humans and the physical world. We envision a future where robots seamlessly collaborate with humans as capable, adaptive partners in everyday life.
