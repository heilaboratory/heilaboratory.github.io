    <strong>The Human-Centered Embodied Intelligence (HEI) Lab at Ajou University</strong> builds robots that learn, adapt, and interact with humans. Our mission is to develop machine learning algorithms for robot learning and human-robot interaction. Our group focuses on: 1) <strong>foundation models for robotics</strong>—enabling robots to generalize across diverse tasks and environments, 2) <strong>human-robot interaction</strong>—establishing natural and collaborative interaction to achieve shared autonomy, and 3) <strong>lifelong robot learning</strong>—building systems that continuously acquire new skills and adapt to changing environments through interaction. We envision a future where robots seamlessly collaborate with humans as capable, adaptive partners in everyday life.
