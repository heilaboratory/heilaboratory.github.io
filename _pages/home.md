    <strong>Human-Centered Embodied Intelligence (HEI) lab at Ajou University</strong> develops AI agents that can see, talk, reason, and act in real-world environments. Our mission is to advance robot learning and human-robot interaction by leveraging semantic, generalizable priors from multimodal AI models. Our research focuses on: 1) <strong>foundation models for robotics</strong>—enabling robots to generalize across diverse tasks and environments, 2) <strong>human-robot interaction</strong>—designing natural and collaborative interactions with humans, and 3) <strong>lifelong robot learning</strong>—building systems that continuously acquire new skills and adapt to changing environments through interaction with humans and environments.
